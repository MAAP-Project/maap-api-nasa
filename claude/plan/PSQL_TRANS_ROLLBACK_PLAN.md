# Database Transaction Rollback Implementation Plan

## **Current Issue**
The codebase has **25+ database commit operations** across 8 files with **NO rollback implementations**. Database failures could leave the system in an inconsistent state.

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Add rollback to member management, organization operations, and admin functions
2. **Phase 2 (Medium)**: Add rollback to job queues, algorithms, and authentication  
3. **Phase 3 (Lower)**: Add rollback to job logging operations

## **Technical Approach**
- Wrap existing `db.session.commit()` calls in try/except blocks
- Add `db.session.rollback()` in exception handlers
- Maintain existing error response formats
- Add proper logging for rollback events

## **Files to Update**
- `api/endpoints/members.py` (5 locations)
- `api/endpoints/organizations.py` + `api/utils/organization.py` 
- `api/endpoints/admin.py` (2 locations)
- `api/utils/job_queue.py`
- `api/endpoints/algorithm.py` (2 locations)
- `api/auth/cas_auth.py` (3 locations)
- `api/endpoints/job.py` (1 location)

This will ensure all PostgreSQL transactions automatically rollback on failure, preventing data corruption and improving system reliability.

## **Detailed Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Critical Database Operations (High Priority)**

#### **1. Member Management (`api/endpoints/members.py`)**
- Add rollback to member creation (lines 205-206)
- Add rollback to member updates (line 275)
- Add rollback to member status changes (lines 323, 336)
- Add rollback to SSH key operations (lines 421, 436)
- Add rollback to member secrets operations (lines 498, 549)

#### **2. Organization Management (`api/endpoints/organizations.py`, `api/utils/organization.py`)**
- Add rollback to organization creation/updates with member assignments
- Add rollback to organization deletion operations
- Add rollback to membership and job queue assignments

#### **3. Admin Operations (`api/endpoints/admin.py`)**
- Add rollback to pre-approved email operations (lines 169, 191)

### **Phase 2: Supporting Operations (Medium Priority)**

#### **4. Job Queue Management (`api/utils/job_queue.py`)**
- Add rollback to queue creation/updates with organization assignments
- Add rollback to queue deletion operations

#### **5. Algorithm Operations (`api/endpoints/algorithm.py`)**
- Add rollback to algorithm publishing (lines 538, 545)

#### **6. Authentication Operations (`api/auth/cas_auth.py`)**
- Add rollback to member session creation (lines 167, 170, 174)

### **Phase 3: Job Operations (Lower Priority)**

#### **7. Job Logging (`api/endpoints/job.py`)**
- Add rollback to job submission logging (lines 120-121)

## **Implementation Pattern**

```python
try:
    db.session.commit()
except Exception as e:
    db.session.rollback()
    app.logger.error(f"Failed to {operation_description}: {e}")
    raise
```

## **Expected Outcome**
- All database operations will have proper rollback on failure
- Improved data consistency and system reliability
- Better error handling and recovery
- Reduced risk of partial database state corruption
